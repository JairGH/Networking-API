# Networking-API

Welcome to the Social Network API project! In this project, you will be building a robust API for a social networking web application. This API will allow users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage their friend list. The project will utilize Express.js for routing, MongoDB for the database, and the Mongoose ODM for data modeling.
